#JavaScript Review: Review Session 2
This past week, we looked at JavaScript, we looked at NodeJS, and we
developed a JukeBox app.

Let's take what we've learned and apply it to what we know about OOP. That
is, let's translate our Pacman, Ghost, and Ball classes from [Ruby]
(http://github.com/ogryzek/oop_review) into JavaScript.

## Ball classes
Our 'Ball' class should have a 'ball_type' attribute whose value can either
be regular or super.

```javascript
//ball.js


```
